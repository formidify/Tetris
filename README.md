The Graphical User Interface curretly contains the BoardDisplay class, the StartDisplay class, 
and the RestartDisplay class. In our use of the MVC design pattern, the GUI (i.e. the BoardDisplay
and the StartDisplay) would give the user a view of the game as well as register the keystrokes 
required to land and rotate the tetris piece while the tetrisController relays the keystrokes to the model, 
which handles game logic. Currently, the BoardDisplay and StartDisplay are fully connected to the
tetrisController and display expected behavior when Tetris is run but the RestartDisplay class is not yet 
fully integrated with the game logic. 

Run Tetris in order to start the game.
